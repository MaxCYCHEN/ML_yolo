- Use the darknet to train the yolo-fastestv1. It is from [dog-qiuqiu/Yolo-Fastest](https://github.com/dog-qiuqiu/Yolo-Fastest) and have pre-train model.

## Build
- The built exe `darknet.exe` or `darknet_no_gpu.exe` are in the folders already and we offer some maybe missing dlls. However, if it doesn't work or using different GPU(RTX 3070~3090), the rebuild is needed.
- The build steps is from here [AlexeyAB/darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). Some issue you may encounter is here `Yolo-Fastest-darknet/training_demo/darknet_cpu_install_win10.txt` or `darknet_gpu_install_win10.txt`.
